This application uses Main class as start point. Application looks for classes in User's home directory
or in the directory specified in the arguments as the first parameters.
If directory doesn't contain jar files, you are promoted to enter path to another directory or exit.
When 1 or more .jars files found, they are printed with numbers. By these numbers you can load
concrete .jars.
Then you are promoted to choose one of the classes that were downloaded from jar file
and call its method.
Then all is repeated again until you exit program through menu.
